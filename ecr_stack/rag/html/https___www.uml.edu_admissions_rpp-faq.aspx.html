            <dd class="comp-faq__answer">
<p>More students apply for fall entry than we can accommodate. We wanted to create a seamless pathway for more students to choose UMass Lowell. If you see yourself at UMass Lowell, this program is perfect for you.</p>            </dd>
            <dt id="answer232228_1" class="comp-faq__question">Is this like being placed on a waitlist?</dt>
            <dd class="comp-faq__answer">
<p>No. This is an offer of admission, contingent on students completing a minimum of 12 transferable credits with a minimum GPA of 2.500. Students on our waitlist have not received an offer of admission. There is no guarantee they will receive one.</p>            </dd>
            <dt id="answer232228_2" class="comp-faq__question">Can’t I just go to community college and transfer to UMass Lowell on my own? </dt>
            <dd class="comp-faq__answer">
<p>You can, and plenty of students do. Enrolling through the Reserved Placement Program has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will not have to reapply for admission to UMass Lowell. Students who meet the requirements of the RPP will be guaranteed entry after a minimum of one semester.</li>
  <li>UMass Lowell will provide academic advising at no cost to you. A dedicated UMass Lowell transfer counselor will work with you to be sure you are taking the correct courses.</li>
  <li>We will regard you as our student from day one. You will have the ability to obtain a UMass Lowell ID card, attend our January orientation, have a UMass Lowell transfer counselor advise you throughout the program, and be welcome to attend UMass Lowell sports games and events.</li>
</ul>            </dd>
            <dt id="answer232228_3" class="comp-faq__question">How do I find out how much it will cost?</dt>
            <dd class="comp-faq__answer">
<p>RPP will lower your costs. When you are enrolled at the community college, you will pay the tuition rates for that community college. When you transfer to UMass Lowell, you will pay <a href="/thesolutioncenter/bill/tuition-fees/" title="Tuition and Fees">UMass Lowell tuition rates</a>.</p>
<p>Students who live on campus will pay <a href="/thesolutioncenter/bill/Room-Board/" title="Housing and Food Plan Costs">UMass Lowell’s Housing and Food Plan Costs</a>.</p>            </dd>
            <dt id="answer232228_4" class="comp-faq__question">Can I stay at the community college for more than a semester?</dt>
            <dd class="comp-faq__answer">
<p>RPP lasts for up to one academic year; however, RPP students can remain at their community college to take advantage of Mass Transfer benefits. They will need to re-apply as a transfer student when they decide to enroll at UMass Lowell.</p>
<p>For continued enrollment in RPP (and housing), students must have a GPA of at least 2.000 after one year. Students who do not maintain the minimum academic requirements will be removed from RPP and housing (as applicable) and will be advised by a transfer counselor on next steps.</p>            </dd>
            <dt id="answer232228_5" class="comp-faq__question">What community colleges can I attend?</dt>
            <dd class="comp-faq__answer">
<p>Middlesex Community College is our primary partner for the Reserved Placement Program. They offer a specific orientation for the Reserved Placement Program, a program coordinator and students are able to live at UMass Lowell while completing their courses at Middlesex Community College.</p>
<p>RPP Students can also enroll at any community college and transition to UMass Lowell (after meeting the requirements of the program). Students will need to complete the application for the community college of their choice and follow the same enrollment process as any new community college student.</p>
